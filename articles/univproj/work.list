------ PARAGRAPHS ANALYSIS ------
Paragraph on results:
- But we need to rename everywhere for fineness
* Lipschitz function extension theorem proof is unfinished
* We need to move Radon Nikodim

Hausdorff:
* actually talk there about restrictions on figures
* write a better version for d-dimensional density

Convergence:
* Vector valued measures - motivation

----- WORK LIST -----
* Rectifiable set criteria proof

* Area formulas

* Add to prerequisits where they are used

Insert what you've done for ENS to english version:
* Move tangents closer to convergence, I loved that structure

Hausdorff measure:
* Change text

Weak convergence of measures:
* Add a motivation

Analysis results section:
* Check proofs

Differentiation of Randon measure:
* I think I might have an error in a proof there

* Move the section about derivatives and other stuff to the beginning
* Move radon nicodim to the acknowledge properties
