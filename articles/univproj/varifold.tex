An $m$-dimensional varifold $V$ is a Radon measure over $\mathbb{R}^n\times
G(n,m)$ endowed with a product topology. We say $\|V\|$ is a measure in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ which is reciprocally projection of a varifold $V$ by $\pi_1^{-1}$.

\textbf{Proposition:} \textit{For varifolds we consider weak-$*$ topology. Then we have a
convergence criteria that $V_i\rightarrow V$ if and only if
\[\int fdV_i\rightarrow\int fdV\]
for every continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\times G(m,n)\rightarrow R$ with a
compact support.}

\textbf{Remarque:} Varifolds let us separate notion of a tangent plane from
geometric properties (actually in computer graphics a similar idea is used for
normal maps), they let us concider possible many planes in the same point with
different masses and also to change the mass of gemetric figure.

\textbf{Definition:} To an $n$-rectifiable set $E$ we can naturally assosiate
a varifold $V_E$ by intruducing a following functional
\[\langle V_E\,|\, f\rangle:=\int_Ef(x,T(E,x))d\mathcal H^m,\quad f\in\mathcal C_c(\mathbb R^n, G(m,n))\]

\textbf{Definition:} By analogy to the variation of submanifolds, one can define
first variation of varifolds as a following functional
\[\delta V:X\in\mathcal C^1_c(\mathbb R^n,\mathbb R^n)\rightarrow\int_{\mathbb R^n\times G_{d,n}}\text{div}_SXdV(x,s)\]
