An $m$-dimensional varifold $V$ is a Radon measure over $\mathbb{R}^n\times
G(n,m)$ endowed with a product topology. We say $\|V\|$ is a measure in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ which is reciprocally projection of a varifold $V$ by $\pi_1^{-1}$.

\textbf{Proposition:} \textit{For varifolds we consider weak-$*$ topology. Then we have a
convergence criteria that $V_i\rightarrow V$ if and only if
\[\int fdV_i\rightarrow\int fdV\]
for every continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\times G(m,n)\rightarrow R$ with a
compact support.}

\textbf{Definition:} To an $n$-rectifiable set $E$ we can naturally assosiate
a varifold $V_E$ by intruducing a following functional
\[\langle V_E\,|\, f\rangle:=\int_Ef(x,T(E,x))d\mathcal H^m,\quad f\in\mathcal C_c(\mathbb R^n, G(m,n))\]
That as we know is also a measure. Such varifolds are called integral.
